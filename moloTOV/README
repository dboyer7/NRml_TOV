Cactus Code Thorn NRml_TOV_ET
Author(s)     : David Boyer
Note          : This code is built off of OdieGM as the heart ODE solver 
		and uses GRHayLib thorn to store EOS data.

==========
1. Purpose
==========

NRml_TOV_ET is the Einstein Toolkit edition of the NRml_TOV solver and adds 
additional features from the original solver, like access to the ET grid and 
variables. It was made to solve the TOV equations, or the equations of 
hydrostatic equilibrium for spherically symmetric static stars, specifically 
Neutron stars. 

==========
2. Support
==========

NRml_TOV_ET supports three types of EOS: Simple Polytrope, Piecewise Polytrope, 
and Tabulated EOS.

At this time, NRml_TOV_ET only allows two adaptive ODE methods from OdieGM: 
RK4(5) and DP7(8). More can be enabled if there is demand, as OdieGM has
many more adaptive and non-adaptive methods to choose from, but the two 
I listed felt sufficient enough.

All these choices can be made in the parfile. No touching the src code is
necessary (as it should). For examples of each EOS type, see the par directory.

3. Output
==========

You can output via ascii data from the toolkit. For raw data, use the standalone solver
outside the toolkit.

==========
4. Testing
==========

This code has been tested against both the NRpy generated TOV solver and 
constraint tested using Baikal.

Simple Polytrope: 
Raw data sits within 10^-12/-13 in relative error with NRpy
Constraint violation goes down with higher resolved grids

Piecewise Polytrope:
Raw data sits within 10^-12/-13 in relative error with NRpy
Constraint violation goes down with higher resolved grids

Tabulated EOS:
Raw data sits within 10^-8 in relative error with NRpy (Mostly from EOS table interpolation)
Constraint violation goes down with higher resolved grids (to interpolation error)
